       <p id = "description">
         SecureDrop is an open-source software platform for secure communication between journalists and sources (whistleblowers).[3] It was originally designed and developed by Aaron Swartz and Kevin Poulsen under the name DeadDrop.[4][5]
         After Aaron Swartz's death, the first instance of the platform was launched under the name Strongbox by staff at The New Yorker on 15 May 2013.[6] The Freedom of the Press Foundation took over development of DeadDrop under the name SecureDrop, and has since assisted with its installation at several news organizations, including ProPublica, The Guardian, The Intercept, and The Washington Post.
